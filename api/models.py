# API models - imports from marketplace app to avoid duplication
# All models are defined in the marketplace app to avoid conflicts

# This file is intentionally minimal to prevent model conflicts
# The actual models (Category, Listing, Message, Favorite, UserProfile) 
# are defined in the marketplace app
