# Pia»õa RO - Production Readiness Checklist

## Current Issues Identified

### 1. Image Upload Issue
- **Symptom**: Only one image is being uploaded despite multiple selection
- **Root Cause Analysis**:
  - Duplicate image preview implementations: one in static/js/image-preview.js and another in add_listing.html template
  - The inline JavaScript in add_listing.html doesn't properly maintain the file list when images are removed
  - Both scripts are trying to handle the same functionality, causing conflicts

### 2. OpenStreetMap Display Issue
- **Symptom**: Displays 5 pieces of maps instead of one
- **Root Cause Analysis**:
  - The map initialization code is correct with proper safeguards (cleanupMap, instance checks)
  - The issue might be related to template rendering or caching causing multiple map elements
  - CSS rules are in place to hide duplicate maps, but the root cause should be addressed

## Production Readiness Tasks

### Security Configuration
- [ ] Set DEBUG = False in production settings
- [ ] Configure proper ALLOWED_HOSTS
- [ ] Set up HTTPS/SSL redirection
- [ ] Configure secure cookies (SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE, CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE)
- [ ] Set up Content Security Policy (CSP)
- [ ] Configure rate limiting
- [ ] Change default admin URL
- [ ] Set up proper secret key management

### Database Configuration
- [ ] Switch from SQLite to PostgreSQL for production
- [ ] Configure database connection pooling
- [ ] Set up database backups
- [ ] Optimize database indexes
- [ ] Configure connection timeouts

### Static and Media Files
- [ ] Configure static files for production (collectstatic)
- [ ] Set up CDN for static files
- [ ] Configure media file storage (S3 or similar)
- [ ] Set up proper file permissions
- [ ] Implement image optimization

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Set up caching (Redis or Memcached)
- [ ] Configure database query optimization
- [ ] Implement pagination for large datasets
- [ ] Optimize image loading
- [ ] Set up Gzip compression
- [ ] Configure browser caching headers

### Monitoring and Logging
- [ ] Set up proper logging configuration
- [ ] Configure error tracking (Sentry or similar)
- [ ] Set up application performance monitoring
- [ ] Configure health checks
- [ ] Set up monitoring alerts

### Deployment Configuration
- [ ] Update Docker configuration for production
- [ ] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Set up proper process management (Gunicorn/Uvicorn)
- [ ] Configure reverse proxy (Nginx)
- [ ] Set up load balancing if needed
- [ ] Configure backup and restore procedures

### Frontend Optimization
- [x] Fix image upload issue - Replace duplicate code with dedicated image-preview.js
- [x] Fix OpenStreetMap display issue - Enhanced cleanup for various navigation scenarios
- [ ] Minify CSS and JavaScript
- [ ] Implement lazy loading
- [ ] Optimize images
- [ ] Set up proper error handling

### Testing and Quality Assurance
- [ ] Run all tests in production-like environment
- [ ] Perform security audit
- [ ] Conduct performance testing
- [ ] Verify all features work correctly
- [ ] Test error handling

### Documentation
- [ ] Update README with production deployment instructions
- [ ] Document environment variables
- [ ] Document API endpoints
- [ ] Document monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Document backup and restore procedures

## Immediate Action Items

1. Remove duplicate image preview code from add_listing.html template
2. Ensure proper map cleanup on page navigation
3. Update production settings
4. Configure database for production
5. Set up proper static and media file handling

## Implementation Details

### Image Upload Fix
Remove the duplicate image preview JavaScript from add_listing.html template and rely on the dedicated image-preview.js file which has proper functionality for handling multiple file uploads and removals.

### OpenStreetMap Fix
The map initialization code is already robust with cleanup functions. The issue might be related to how the template is being rendered. Ensure that:
1. The map element has a unique ID
2. The cleanup functions are called on all page navigation events
3. No duplicate map elements are being created in the template
